# Biography-Homework

## Description
This will become a three page website with navigating buttons in the top right of the page. The first is basic information - name, photo, bio. The second has a list of projects - the portfolio. The last is the contact page with a list of ways to get in touch.

as of Saturday, December 21, 11:11pm

The Challenges / New Knowledge Gained:
   Mastered the navigational buttons and landed them in the header line.  Still want to give them individual buttons and margin between. Need to find out why the navigational "buttons" won't go flush to the edge of their container.

   Originally had the white background for the header, however, it went away when working on getting the buttons in the header. Need to learn how to make that area independent from the background image.

   I had started working on the sticky footer when I was stuck on the header/navigation issue. There are many ways to approach this, and I didn't get through all of the possibilities before I was able to move forward with the header. Thus, the sticky footer will be one of the early "to do" items this week.

   The photo is not to size, but that's fine with me as I don't like it. I will recode the image and, possibly, get a new one!

   In the rest of my day post-class, I was able to rewatch last Saturday's class and the box positioning. I believe the portfolio mock-up will be straight forward. I hope to have it done for Christmas.

   The final page with contact information does not concern me, either - except that it will be fun to learn all of the possibilities because I need to use them in my real life job soon. I will try to stay focussed and also have this done for Christmas.

   Hope you all are having a restful break - outside of grading our homework :)

   First, I added the reset.css which helped to see where some errors were. Then  I was successful at getting the first page to "look" correct - with some sloppy practices which I hope to learn to do better. For some reason it won't listen to the "text-decoration: none" command, so my buttons have the link underlines, frustrating.

   I chose to leave the footer as stuck to the bottom because as a small footer, it doesn't take up enough space to be an eyesore.

   Now I'm on to the next pages!

      Yessss, I found the way to tell code not to underline hyperlinks - in the html, not the css where I had been beating my head!

      And, I'm starting over on the page 2 because I was going down the grid method which didn't seem to allow the banner with the job/website name on it. So, I finally slapped my forehead and said, "use what they taught, not what they did not teach" duh! So, I have 2 portfolio html and css files. I will delete the losers once I have it perfect :)
